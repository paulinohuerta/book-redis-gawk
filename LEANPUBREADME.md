- How to build custom Markdown extensions using Kramdown. For stuff like;
  - code bubbles
  - notes
  - asides 
  - and other nifty little doodads
- How various html ebook format wrappers (such as ePub, mobi etc) work. No magic!
- Common markdown pitfalls (I documented all my failures while writing this book)
- Various techniques for previewing your Markdown output 
  - Sublime Text Previewing
  - html previews
  - automatic previews using the guard gem
- How to mirror the Leanpub workflow using local tools

- The minimal laTeX you'll need to get stuff done with PDF

## What you need to know

Some hacker skills are necessary to make full use of this book. To write books using Markdown you'll need to be
comfortable getting your hands dirty, breaking things and learning. This book doesn't assume 
you're skilled in any particular language but it assumes you are skilled in programming. Familiarity with your systems 
package manager will be necessary.

Can you do this?
    $ homebrew install

Or if you are on Linux this?
    $ sudo apt-get install

If this leaves you scratching your head then you are not ready for this book. If you are left feeling
comfortable and at ease, not queasy and fearful, then you are ready.

Some rudimentary ability to read and edit Ruby will also be necessary. If you are comfortable enough to edit Gemfiles 
and install gems using bundler then you should be fine.

## Planned Chapters

Chapters on the following topics are planned;

- Using [Quarto](https://github.com/avdi/quarto) and PDFKit to generate PDFs from XHTML + CSS 
- Web based books with runnable consoles and code samples 

## Will be updated continuously 

The tools and techniques used to make ebooks change swiftly and often drastically. I intend to continue writing ebooks into the foreseeable future and will continue to update this book as I discover new things. Thus, this book will always mirror closely my current workflow for writing and publishing ebooks.
