# An Introduction

Redis is a lightweight and simple data structure server.
It's written in ANSI C, easy to install.
Redis is capable to store your strings, lists, hashes, sets, and some other fancy structures, sharing them between processes.
Redis works with an in-memory dataset.
For instance, If I were writing a web app, I might cache session data, share data between different processes in real time, and other more sophisticated things.
