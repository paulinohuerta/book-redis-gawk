# Wrap Up

## Notes

These are the longer notes that couldn't find a place in the footnotes.

### Monkeypatching
{:#monkeypatching}

Monkey-patching is simply a way of extending classes after their creation. For example:

{:lang="ruby"}
    class String
      def cats
      end
    end

Would result in a method called `cats` being added to all string objects. See google for more info.

## The End

No overkill with appendixes, summaries, and indexes in this book. Sometimes books read like an author didn't want it to
end. This book has come to close, no reason to drag it on.

Until the bots learn Markdown, write a manifesto advocating the destruction of mankind, spurring an uprising of the
machines,
